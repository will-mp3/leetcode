"""
This code defines a solution to count the number of triplets in an integer array that can form the sides of a triangle. The function `triangleNumber` takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns an integer representing the count of valid triplets. The approach used in this solution can be broken down into the following steps:
1. Sort the input array `nums` to facilitate the triangle inequality checks.
2. Initialize a variable `ans` to 0, which will hold the count of valid triplets.
3. Iterate through the sorted array in reverse order, treating each element as the potential longest side of a triangle (`c`).
4. For each selected longest side, use a two-pointer technique to find pairs of sides (`nums[start]` and `nums[end]`) that can form a triangle with `c`. The two pointers start at the beginning and just before the current longest side.
5. While the `start` pointer is less than the `end` pointer, check if the sum of the two sides is greater than the longest side (`c`):
   - If true, it means all pairs between `start` and `end` can form a triangle with `c`, so add `end - start` to `ans` and move the `end` pointer left.
   - If false, move the `start` pointer right to increase the sum.
6. Continue this process until all possible longest sides have been considered.
7. Finally, return the value of `ans`, which contains the total count of valid triplets.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array, due to the nested loops (one for selecting the longest side and another for the two-pointer search). The space complexity is O(1) since the sorting is done in place and no additional data structures are used that scale with input size.
