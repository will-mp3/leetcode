"""
You are given an array nums of size n, consisting of non-negative integers. Your task is to apply some (possibly zero) operations on the array so that all elements become 0.

In one operation, you can select a subarray [i, j] (where 0 <= i <= j < n) and set all occurrences of the minimum non-negative integer in that subarray to 0.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array 0.
