"""
This code defines a solution to find the area of the rectangle with the longest diagonal from a list of rectangle dimensions.
The `areaOfMaxDiagonal` method iterates through each rectangle's dimensions in the input list. For each rectangle, it calculates the length of the diagonal using the Pythagorean theorem (sqrt(length^2 + width^2)).
It keeps track of the maximum diagonal length encountered so far (`maxDiag`) and the corresponding area (`res`). If a rectangle has a longer diagonal than the current maximum, it updates both `maxDiag` and `res`. 
If a rectangle has a diagonal equal to the current maximum, it updates `res` to be the maximum of the current area and the new rectangle's area.
Finally, it returns the area of the rectangle with the longest diagonal. If there are multiple rectangles with the same longest diagonal, it returns the area of the one with the maximum area.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of rectangles in the input list, as it processes each rectangle exactly once.
